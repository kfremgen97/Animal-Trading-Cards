# Animal Trading Card

### Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanodegree Project

Simply titled, "Animal Trading Cards", this project asks you to re-create a webpage from a design prototype.

This is a common workflow for front-end web developers.
Typically, you'll be provided with a design prototype that needs to be translated to an actual, functional website.
In most cases, designers only provide you with the design prototype.
